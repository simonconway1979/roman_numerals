#Roman Numerals - Instructions


The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters:

-'I' meaning '1'
-'V' meaning '5'
-'X' meaning '10'
-'L' meaning '50'
-'C' meaning '100'
-'D' meaning '500'
-'M' meaning '1000'

The Rules:

The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row.
The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated.
The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM').
Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not).
The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.
